Quinoa Drought Tolerance Analysis (M.Sc. Thesis, Wageningen University)

This Python code snippet implements a reverse genetics approach to predict potential mutations in quinoa DNA that could lead to detrimental changes in protein structure. It iterates through single nucleotide polymorphisms (SNPs) and analyzes their impact on protein structure during a drought tolerance study.

Functionality:
Iterates through SNPs: The code iterates through potential single nucleotide changes in the DNA sequence.
Predicts Protein Structure: For each SNP, it predicts the resulting protein structure.
Analyzes Structural Changes: It compares the predicted structure with the original structure to identify potential disruptions caused by the mutation.
This code allows researchers to identify candidate SNPs that might be associated with reduced drought tolerance in quinoa.
